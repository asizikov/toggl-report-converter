# toggl-report-converter

This is a little utility which I am using to format my timesheets.

I'm using [toggl](https://toggl.com) time tracker to keep records of hours spent working for my client.

On the first days of each month, I download a 'Detailed report' from toggl, and convert it to the format my client accepts.

## How to use

```bash

Report.exe /Users/user/Downloads/Toggl_time_entries_2017-06-01_to_2017-06-30.csv /Users/user/Desktop

```

That would produce a report named as `June 2017.csv` (previous month)
